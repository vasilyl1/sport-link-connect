## Description

SportLink Connect is a web application which aims to match lonely athletes to each other based on their geographical location and training preference. It demonstrates how users can sign up, login and have their favorited point of interest saved on local storage.

## Installation

click the link [here](https://vasilyl1.github.io/Sport-Link-Connect/), sign-up at the top of the page, login, type in your desired location to connect and double click your favourite points of interest. If another athlete were to login, they would be able to view the previous members locations and would be prompted to connect (this function is to be added in a future update).
